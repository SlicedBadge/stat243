The goal of the simulation study presented in the article was to see the performance of a null hypothesis test in a controlled setting. They do this by comparing their hypothesis test with a non-adjusted hypothesis test using the same data.
They measure the effectiveness of their adjusted hypothesis test by looking at the difference in significance levels and power of the two tests in a variety of settings.
The authors chose to test certain mixing parameters to generate the samples from and test their hypotheses. They also do not mention how these samples were generated which probably would be worth mentioning for the sake of thoroughness.
The tables seem to make sense and do a decent job of showing how the tests are more powerful as more samples are drawn or as the distributions being mixed get farther apart (and thus easier to distinguish).
The authors probably used 1000 replications based off of an attempt to balance rigor with computational efficiency. 10 replications would probably not be enough. We could determine the appropriate number of replications by looking at the distribution of the results. One would expect them to approach a normal distribution with enough replications.
